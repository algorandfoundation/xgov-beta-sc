The _on-chain_ components are used for:

1. Onboarding xGov;
1. Whitelisting Proposers (KYC required);
1. Creating and submitting Proposals;
1. Binding xGov Committees to Proposals;
1. Voting on Proposals;
1. Managing the xGov Treasury and funding approved Proposals.

The _off-chain_ components are used for:

1. Selecting xGov Committees periodically and verifiably, according to [ARC-86](https://dev.algorand.co/arc-standards/arc-0086);
1. Intermediate Proposersâ€™ KYC;
1. Intermediate onboarding of xGovs that cannot execute a self-onboarding.
