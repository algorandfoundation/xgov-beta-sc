# xGov Registry

The xGov Registry is the orchestrator of the xGov process. It is used to:

- Manage the [role-based access control](./xgov-rbac.md) of the process;

- Onboard and offboard [xGovs](./xgovs.md);

- Onboard and enable [Proposers](./proposers.md) (KYC required);

- Create [Proposals](./proposal-creation.md);

- Bind the [xGov Committees](./proposal-submission.md) to Proposals;

- [Vote on Proposals](./proposal-vote.md);

- Manage the [xGov Treasury](./xgov-treasury.md) and funding approved Proposals.

The xGov Registry is implemented as an Application, deployed by the original [xGov
Manager](xgov-rbac.md#xgov-manager).
